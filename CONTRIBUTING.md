## Best Practices for Contributing

Postadepo welcomes contributions from the community. We're a small team, so please be patient while your contributions are reviewed. Bug fixes will be prioritized, but we love to hear from the community!  

---

### Features
- For new features, please open a **Discussion** before creating a Pull Request (PR).  
- This allows the team and community to provide feedback and ensure the feature aligns with project goals.

### Refactoring
- If you are refactoring code, include a brief explanation of your changes and how they improve the project.  
- Example: ‚ÄúSimplified database query logic to reduce load time.‚Äù

### Bug Fixes
- Include clear steps to reproduce the bug **before and after** your fix.  
- Tests are preferred but step-by-step examples are also appreciated.

### Pull Request Hygiene
- Contributions must pass **all tests and CI checks** before merging.  
- Only mark the PR as **Ready for Review** when it is complete.  
- If you struggle with a failing test, leave a note in your PR; otherwise, it may be assumed as WIP.

### Code Style
- Follow the existing project style for consistency.  
- Use **Conventional Commits** for commit messages to make release notes easier to generate.
